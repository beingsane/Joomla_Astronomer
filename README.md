#4 - Profile plugin
Derived from the existing joomla profile plugin.  It consists of just 4 fields.

*UserID* - Derived from the Joomla users tables.  And will be the user filling out the form, ALWAYS!
This is to link the profile to the Joomla user table.

*UserObserverName* **REQUIRED** - This is the Name that the user is known by and is used as the entry form default.

*UserObservatory* **REQUIRED** - This is a official 3 character designator for their particular observatory.
This saves time on form entry and is used for the entry form defaults.

*UserHeader* **REQUIRED** - This is the official header required for astrometry listings.

*UserScope* **REQUIRED** - This is the default scope used for observations.  This saves time on form entry and is used for the entry form default.
